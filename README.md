## Notes

This is a combination of:

https://github.com/void4/keyfuck/ - Which had a key-only design, but only ultra-simple brainfuck semantics. This also used the KeyKOS architecture of Node/KeyLists of size 16, tree construction with workbenches to access a larger number of keys.

https://github.com/void4/keyvm-old - Which had a stack based VM, but domains where not exclusively keys, they also contained a fixed code memory and stack.
